These key terms can help you understand the way that the service breaks down the authorization and authentication process.

<dl>
  <dt>Access tokens</dt>
    <dd><p>Access tokens represent authorization and enable communication with [back-end resources](/docs/services/appid/protecting-resources.html) that are protected by authorization filters that are set by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}. The token conforms to JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) specifications. The tokens are formatted as <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/" target="blank">JSON Web Tokens <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.</br>
    Example:</p>
    <pre><code>Header: {
        "typ": "JOSE",
        "alg": "RS256",
    }
    Payload: {
        "iss": "appid-oauth.ng.bluemix.net",
        "exp": "1495562664",
        "aud": "a3b87400-f03b-4956-844e-a52103ef26ba",
        "amr": ["facebook"],
        "sub": "de6a17d2-693d-4a43-8ea2-2140afd56a22",
        "iat": "1495559064",
        "tenant": "9781974b-6a1c-46c3-aebf-32b7e9bbbaee",
        "scope": "appid_default appid_readprofile appid_readuserattr appid_writeuserattr",
    </code></pre></dd>
  <dt>Identity tokens</dt>
    <dd><p>Identity tokens represent authentication and contain information about the user. It can give you information about their name, email, gender, and location. A token can also return a URL to an image of the user.</br>
    Example:</p>
    <pre><code>Header: {
        "typ": "JOSE",
        "alg": "RS256",
    }
    Payload: {
        "iss": "appid-oauth.ng.bluemix.net",
        "aud": "a3b87400-f03b-4956-844e-a52103ef26ba",
        "exp: "1495562664",
        "tenant": "9781974b-6a1c-46c3-aebf-32b7e9bbbaee",
        "iat": "1495559064",
        "name": "John Smith",
        "email": "js@mail.com",
        "gender", "male",
        "locale": "en",
        "picture": "<URL-to-photo>",
        "sub": "de6a17d2-693d-4a43-8ea2-2140afd56a22",
        "identities": [
            "provider": "facebook"
            "id": "377440159275659"
        ],
        "amr": ["facebook"],
        "oauth_client":{
          "name": "BluemixApp",
          "type": "serverapp",
          "software_id": "cb638f8f-e24b-41d3-b770-23be158dd8e6.2b94e6bb-bac4-4455-8712-a43fa804d5cc.a3b87400-f03b-4956-844e-a52103ef26ba",
          "software_version": "1.0.0",
        }
    }
    </pre></code></dd>
  <dt>Refresh Token</dt>
      <dd><p>{{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} supports the ability to acquire new access and identity tokens without reauthentication, as defined in <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokens" target="_blank">OIDC <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
      When signing in with a refresh token, a user doesn't have to take any actions, such as providing credentials. Generally, refresh tokens are configured to have a longer life span than a regular access token.</p><p>
      To take full advantage of refresh tokens, persist the tokens for their full life span. A user cannot directly access resources with just a refresh token, which makes them much safer to persist than an access token. For examples of working with refresh tokens and how to use them to implement a *remember me* functionality, check out the getting started samples.</p><p>As a best practice, refresh tokens should be securely stored by the client that received them, and should only be sent to the authorization server that issued them.</p></dd>
  <dt>Authorization headers</dt>
    <dd><p>{{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} complies with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750" target="blank">token bearer specification <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> and uses a combination of access and identity tokens that are sent as an HTTP Authorization header. The Authorization header contains three different parts that are separated by white space. The tokens are base64 encoded. The identity token is optional.</br>
    Example:</p>
    <pre><code>Authorization=Bearer {access_token} [{id_token}]</pre></code></dd>
  <dt>API Strategy</dt>
    <dd><p>The API strategy expects requests to contain an authorization header with a valid access token. The request can also include an identity token, but it is not required. If a token is invalid or expired, the API strategy returns an HTTP 401 error that contains the following HTTP header:</p> <pre><code>Www-Authenticate=Bearer scope="{scope}" error="{error}"</code></pre>
    <p>If the request returns a valid token, control is passed to the next middleware and the <code>appIdAuthorizationContext</code> property is injected into the request object. This property contains original access and identity tokens, and decoded payload information as plain JSON objects.</dd>
  <dt>Web app strategy</dt>
    <dd>When the web app strategy detects unauthorized attempts to access a protected resource, it automatically redirects a user's browser to the authentication page, which can be provided by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}. After successful authentication, the user is returned to the web app's callback URL. The web app strategy obtains access and identity tokens and stores them in an HTTP session under <code>WebAppStrategy.AUTH_CONTEXT</code>. It is up to the user to decide whether to store access and identity tokens in the app database.</dd>
  <dt>Data separation and encryption</dt>
    <dd><p>{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} stores and encrypts user profile attributes. As a multi-tenant service, every tenant has a designated encryption key and user data in each tenant is encrypted with only that tenant's key.</p>
    <p>{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} ensures that private information is encrypted before it is stored.</p></dd>
