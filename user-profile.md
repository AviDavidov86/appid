**What is a user profile?**

A user profile is a collection of attributes that are stored by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}. Attributes are pieces of information about the users that interact with your app. There are two types of attributes that can be obtained: `predefined` and `custom`.

**What are predefined attributes?**

Predefined attributes are returned by the identity provider when your user signs into your app. The attributes might include their username, ages, or gender.

**What are custom attributes?**

Custom attributes are learned about your users as they interact with your app.  This might be the font size that they use or items that they have placed in a shopping cart. Custom attributes can be edited.

## Accessing user attributes
{: #access}

There are different ways in which you can access user profile information. After a successful user authentication your app receives access and identity tokens. The identity token contains a normalized subset of user attributes that are returned by an identity provider. To get the full list of user attributes you can use the OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint. To manage custom attributes, you can use the `REST API`. Both the userinfo and the custom attribute endpoints are protected by the access token that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} at the end of the authentication process.
