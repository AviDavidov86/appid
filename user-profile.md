# Understanding user profiles
{: #user-profile}

With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}, you can build personalized app experiences by accessing the information about your users that is stored by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

A user profile is a collection of attributes that are stored by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}. Attributes are pieces of information about the users that interact with your app. There are two types of attributes that can be obtained: `predefined` and `custom`. Predefined user attributes are returned by the identity provider when your user signs into your app. The attributes might include their username, ages, or gender. Custom attributes are learned about your users as they interact with your app. This might be the font size that they use or items that they have placed in a shopping cart.

There are different ways in which you can access user profile information. After a successful user authentication your app receives access and identity tokens. The identity token contains a normalized subset of user attributes that are returned by an identity provider. To get the full list of user attributes you can use the OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint. To manage custom attributes, you can use the `REST API`. Both the userinfo and the custom attribute endpoints are protected by the access token that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} at the end of the authentication process.

To see custom attributes, you can use the <a href="https://appid-profiles.ng.bluemix.net/swagger-ui/index.html#/Attributes" target="_blank">REST API <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.

## Understanding identity tokens
{: #identity}

When sign-in occurs with an [identity provider](/docs/services/appid/identity-providers.html), information about the user is returned as part of an identity token. Identity tokens represent authentication and contain information about the user such as their name, gender, or locale. The service takes that raw identity provider data and normalizes it to return a profile. Other data is stored in raw form, but can be accessed through the `userinfo` endpoint.

Typically, the returned information takes the following form:

```
// Normalized Profile
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@gmail.com",
    "picture": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdbhg/AAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAA/42rbcbv5M/photo.jpg",
    "gender": "male",
    "locale": "en",
}
```
