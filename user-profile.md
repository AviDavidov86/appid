# Understanding user profiles
{: #user-profile}

With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}, you can build personalized app experiences by accessing the information about your users that is stored by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.

**What is a user profile?**

A user profile is a collection of attributes that are stored by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}. Attributes are pieces of information about the users that interact with your app. There are two types of attributes that can be obtained: `predefined` and `custom`.

</br>

**What are predefined attributes?**

Predefined attributes are returned by the identity provider when your user signs into your app. The attributes might include their username, ages, or gender.

</br>

**What are custom attributes?**

Custom attributes are learned about your users as they interact with your app. Custom attributes can also be set by you prior to the user signing into your app for the first time. An example might be the font size that they prefer or items that they have placed in a shopping cart. Custom attributes can be edited. Be sure to check out the [security implications](custom-attributes.html#security) that can occur by allowing users to edit their attributes prior to changing the default.

## Accessing user attributes
{: #access}

There are different ways in which you can access [predefined](predefined.html) and [custom](custom-attributes.html) attributes. After a successful user authentication, your app receives access and identity tokens. The identity token contains a normalized subset of user attributes that are returned by an identity provider. To get the full list of user attributes you can use the OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint. To manage custom attributes, you can use the `REST API`. Both the userinfo and the custom attribute endpoints are protected by the access token that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} at the end of the authentication process.

For more information about identity and access tokens, see [Understanding tokens](/docs/services/appid/authorization.html#tokens) or [Validating tokens](/docs/services/appid/tokens.html).
