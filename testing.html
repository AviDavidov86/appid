        <p class="shortdesc">Application security can be incredibly complicated. For most developers, it&#39;s one of the hardest parts of creating an app. How can you be sure that you are protecting your user&#39;s information? By integrating IBM&reg; Cloud App ID into your
          apps, you can secure resources and add authentication - even when you don&#39;t have much security experience.</p>
        <section id="section-about-reasons">
          <h2 id="about-reasons">Reasons to use the service</h2>
          <p class="shortdesc">App ID helps developers to easily add authentication to their web and mobile apps with few lines of code, and secure their Cloud-native applications and services on IBM Cloud. By requiring users to sign in to your app, you can store user data
            such as app preferences, or information from public social profiles, and then leverage that data to customize each user&#39;s experience within the app. App ID provides a log-in framework for you, but you can also bring your own branded screens
            to use with Cloud Directory.</p>
          <p>What can Cloud Directory do for you? Check out this video to learn more about the different ways that you can use the service and then read more in the following table about other scenarios.</p>

          <h2 id="about-how-it-works">How it works</h2>
          <p class="shortdesc">With App ID, you can add a level of security to your apps by requiring users to sign in. You can also use the server SDK or APIs to protect your back-end resources.</p>
          <p><img src="images/appid_architecture1.png" alt="App ID architecture diagram"></p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Application</dt>
            <dd><strong>Server SDK</strong>: You can protect your back-end resources that are hosted on IBM Cloud and your web apps by using the server SDK. It extracts the access token from a request and validates it with App ID. <br>
              <strong>Client SDK</strong>: You can protect your mobile apps with the Android or iOS client SDK. The client SDK communicates with your cloud resources to start the authentication process when it detects an authorization challenge.</dd>
            <dt>IBM Cloud</dt>
            <dd><strong>App ID</strong>: After successful authentication, App ID returns access and identity tokens to your app.<br>
              <strong>Cloud Directory</strong>: Users can sign up for your service with their email and a password. You can then manage your users in a list view through the UI. With Cloud Directory, App ID functions as your identity provider.</dd>
            <dt>External (third party)</dt>
            <dd><strong>Social and enterprise identity providers</strong>: App ID supports Facebook, Google+, and SAML 2.0 Federation as identity provider options. The service arranges a redirect to the identity provider and verifies the returned authentication
              tokens. If the tokens are valid, the service grants access to your app without ever having access to the actual passphrase.</dd>

        <section id="section-about-compliance">
          <h2 id="about-compliance">Compliance and standards</h2>
          <p class="shortdesc">App ID has successfully completed several certifications, audits, and standards. </p>
          <p>App ID is based on a set of well-known, industry standard protocols and specifications that are frequently found in both enterprise and and consumer facing applications, the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and Open ID Connect. OAuth 2.0 is
            used to obtain and verify authorization for accessing protected resources. On top of that, Open ID Connect adds a layer of a authentication and identity protection to your application.</p>
          <p>See section 5.4 of the App ID software product compatibility report to review a complete list of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=BF31C8008D7C11E59F9AD7336D7D0FFB">certifications</a>.
            In addition to the certifications, App ID is also compliant in the following specifications: Oauth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Token (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM). </p>

          <h2 id="ha-dr">Regional high-availability</h2>
          <p class="shortdesc">App ID is a highly available, regional service that runs in multiple zones.</p>
          <p>In each supported multizone region, every zone has its own IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster with several worker nodes. Each worker node runs several instances of App ID components. Each region is fronted by a global load balancer and a web
            application firewall.</p>
          <p>Data that is stored in App ID is encrypted and persisted in a database cluster that is spread across availability zones. The data is also back up in a separate encrypted object storage.</p>
          <p>Because App ID is a regional service, it does not provide automated cross-regional failover or cross-regional disaster recovery. However, App ID does provide an <a href="https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui/#/" target="_blank">extensive API<img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>            that developers can use to manually synchronize their service configuration with another instance or instances of App ID.</p>
