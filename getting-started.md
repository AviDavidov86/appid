# Getting started tutorial

Application security can be incredibly complicated. For most developers, it's one of the hardest parts of creating an app. How can you be sure that you are protecting your users information? By integrating {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}} into your apps, you can secure resources and add authentication; even when you don't have a lot of security experience.

{: note}

By requiring users to sign in to your app, you can store user data such as app preferences or information from the public social profiles, and then use that data to customize each experience of your app. {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} provides a framework for you, but you can also bring your own branded sign in screens when working with cloud directory.

## Configuring a sample app
{: #sample-app}

You can use one of the preconfigured sample apps to get familiar with working with the service.
{: shortdesc}

Out of the box, the sample apps are configured with two identity providers and the ability to review authentication. Sample apps are offered in `iOS Swift`, `Android`, `Node.js`, and `Java`. If you don't see a language in which you feel comfortable working, don't worry! You can integrate {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} into your own sample application by using the provided APIs.

To build a sample app:

1. Click **Download Sample**.
2. Click on the language of your choice to download the sample.
  Don't see the language you're looking for? Don't worry! You can take advantage of {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} through the APIs.

3. Be sure that you have the pre-requisites installed or completed.
4. Follow the **Build & Run** steps to set up your sample with {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.

## Next steps
{: #next}

Ready to jump in and get started with your own apps? Start by [adding the service to your app](/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-web-apps#web-apps). The service provides SDKs for the most used languages, but if you don't see an SDK for the language that your app is written in, you can still take advantage of {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} by using the APIs.
